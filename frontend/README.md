# Club Attendance Frontend

This is a minimal React + Vite frontend scaffold for the Club Attendance Manager backend.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Environment

- Set `VITE_API_URL` to point to your backend (default: `http://localhost:4000`).

Notes

- This is a starter scaffold with AuthContext, basic pages and UI components. Expand components, add tests, and wire additional API endpoints per your backend routes.
